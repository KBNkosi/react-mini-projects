# Tours App

A React application that displays tour packages fetched from an API. Users can browse through available tours, read details about each tour, and remove tours they're not interested in.

## What I Learned

- Working with React's useState and useEffect hooks
- Fetching data from an external API
- Implementing loading states
- Conditional rendering in React
- Handling user interactions and state updates
